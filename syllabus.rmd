## Learning outcomes (knowledge, skills, social competence and attitude):

The student understands the theoretical framework for statistical methods applied to the biological sciences, specifically generalized linear models for count and binomial data and mixed models for clustered data.

* Skills

The student can:

- effectively create exploratory, diagnostic, and expository graphs from data
- choose and execute an appropriate statistical analysis for a given set of data and scientific questions
- execute, trouble-shoot, and interpret the results of generalized, linear mixed, and generalized linear mixed models.

* Social competence and attitude

The student can:

- communicate the scientific questions to be asked, justify and explain the connection to the results of a statistical analysis
- appreciate the importance of rigorous and ethical approaches to statistical analysis, avoiding data snooping

## Prerequisites:

Theoretical knowledge and practical skills in applying statistical methods at the basic level:

* understanding basic concepts (types of measurement scales, probability, basic types of distributions, central limit theorem, measures of central tendency and dispersion, variance, standard deviation, standard error, confidence interval, parameter, estimator, statistical test, statistical null and alternative hypotheses, type I and type II errors, significance level);
* understanding and practical ability to perform basic statistical analyses (e.g. Student's t-test)
* understanding of basic linear models and their implementation in R: simple analysis of regression and correlation, simple analysis of variance, multiple regression and ANCOVA.
* Basic proficiency in the R programming language.
